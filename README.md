# Build a Tribute Page
##### Hello! It’s me! Someone who truly enjoys the learning journey on the path to becoming a great programmer. 
#
This is my second project in the freeCodeCamp course to earn a certificate in 'Responsive Web Design.' This time, I wanted to create a tribute page. For this project, I was tasked with making a tribute page that included a brief biography of Dr. Norman Borlaug. It was definitely more challenging than the previous project, but thankfully, I managed to complete it well using the notes I took during the lessons and practice sessions. Here, I’m sharing my code for the tribute page.

Enjoy!
